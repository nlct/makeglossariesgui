DESCRIPTION
===========

MakeGlossariesGUI is a Java GUI that can be used as a diagnostic
tool when there are problems with a document that uses the
glossaries package.

It can also be used as alternative to the makeglossaries
Perl script and the makeglossaries-lite.lua Lua script supplied by 
the glossaries package (ctan.org/pkg/glossaries). However, since
it requires the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) it naturally has
larger overheads than a simple Perl or Lua script.

Third Party Libraries
=====================

MakeGlossariesGUI depends on the following third party libraries
whose jar files are placed in the application's lib directory by
the installer:

 - Java Help (https://javahelp.java.net/) GPL
 - The Java Look and Feel Graphics Repository
   (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index-138612.html)
   JLFGR License

If you want to build the application, you will need to fetch those
jar files and add them to the lib directory.
