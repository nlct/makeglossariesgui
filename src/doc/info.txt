DESCRIPTION
===========

MakeGlossariesGUI is a Java GUI that can be used as a diagnostic
tool when there are problems with a document that uses the
glossaries package.

It can also be used as alternative to the makeglossaries
Perl script and the makeglossaries-lite.lua Lua script supplied by
the glossaries package (ctan.org/pkg/glossaries). However, since
it requires the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) it naturally has
larger overheads than a simple Perl or Lua script.
