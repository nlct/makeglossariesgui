     <p>
     The <LaTeX /> <sty>glossaries</sty> package has three methods
     of generating a glossary (list of abbreviations, terms or symbols):
     directly using <LaTeX />, using makeindex or using xindy.
     The first option requires two <LaTeX/> runs (as with cross-references),
     the last two options requires a <LaTeX/> run followed by running
     the indexing application (makeindex or xindy), followed by another
     <LaTeX/> run. The <sty>glossaries</sty> package provides a Perl
     script called makeglossaries that's intended to simply this step
     for options 2 and 3. However, sometimes things can go wrong and users
     may not be able to work out why. The makeglossaries script tries to
     diagnose problems, but not everyone wants to install Perl for some
     reason (which is a shame, as there are some useful <TeX/>-related
     Perl scripts, including xindy).
     </p>
     <p>
     If things go wrong, <app/> can be used instead of makeglossaries to
     diagnose problems and build the required glossary files. It's 
     written in Java, so you'll need the Java Runtime Environment installed.
     </p>
     <p>The <app/> 
     application runs in <acr tag="gui" /> mode by default, but can
     be run in batch mode using the <opt tag="batch"/> command line option.
     Command line invocation:
     </p>
     <p align="center">
      <app/> [<meta>options</meta>]
     </p>
     <p noindent="true">
     Available options:
     <dl>
       <dt><opt tag="batch"/> (or <tt>-b</tt>)</dt>
       <dd>
       Invoke <app/> in batch mode (default).
       </dd>
       <dt><opt tag="version"/> (or <tt>-v</tt>)</dt>
       <dd>Print the version details to STDOUT and exit.</dd>
       <dt><opt tag="help"/> (or <tt>-h</tt>)</dt>
       <dd>Print a brief summary of available options to STDOUT and exit.</dd>
